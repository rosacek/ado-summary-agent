# ADO Summary Agent (Local CPU)

An intelligent Azure DevOps work item analysis system that generates deterministic, fact-based executive summaries using AI with comprehensive 3-month history integration.

## 🎯 Purpose

Automatically analyzes Azure DevOps work items with their complete history, comments, and relationships to generate structured executive summaries. Eliminates AI hallucinations through strict deterministic prompting and provides rich context from 3-month filtered activity.

## 🔒 Security & Data Protection

### Enterprise-Grade Security Design
- **Zero Cloud AI Exposure**: All AI processing runs locally using Ollama + Phi-3.5 model
- **No Internet Ports**: No web servers or external API endpoints that could expose data
- **Local CPU Processing**: Sensitive work item data never leaves your machine
- **Direct ADO Integration**: Uses standard Azure DevOps REST API with your existing credentials
- **No Third-Party AI Services**: Eliminates data sharing with OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or other cloud providers

### Data Protection Features
- **Air-Gapped AI**: Work item descriptions, comments, and sensitive project data processed entirely offline
- **Credential Security**: PAT tokens stored in environment variables, never hardcoded
- **Local File Output**: Summaries saved to local files, no cloud storage required
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Command-line tool with no network listeners or exposed services
- **Microsoft Compliance**: Uses only Microsoft-approved Azure DevOps APIs

### Perfect for Enterprise Environments
- **Behind Corporate Firewalls**: Works in restricted network environments
- **Confidential Projects**: Suitable for sensitive intellectual property and customer data
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets data residency and processing requirements
- **Internal Use Only**: No external dependencies for AI processing once model is downloaded

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Core Architecture
- **ContextBuilder**: Extracts structured data with 120k character context window
- **Summarizer**: Deterministic AI processing using Ollama + Phi-3.5 model  
- **Agent**: Orchestrates 3-month history integration and professional formatting
- **ADOClient**: Azure DevOps API integration for work items and history

### Processing Workflow
1. **Fetch**: Work items via Azure DevOps API with relationships
2. **History**: Pull 3-month filtered comments and changes
3. **Context**: Build structured data (120k character capacity)
4. **AI**: Generate fact-based summaries (temperature=0.1)
5. **Format**: Apply professional markdown structure
6. **Output**: Save to `work_item_summaries.md`

## 🚀 Setup & Prerequisites

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama with `phi3.5:3.8b-mini-instruct-q4_K_M` model
- Azure DevOps access credentials

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment (.env file)
ADO_URL=https://dev.azure.com/yourorg
ADO_PROJECT_NAME=YourProject  
ADO_PAT=your_personal_access_token
WORK_ITEM_IDS=1,2,3  # Comma-separated IDs

# 3. Setup Ollama model
ollama pull phi3.5:3.8b-mini-instruct-q4_K_M

# 4. Run
python src/main.py
```

## 📊 Input & Output

### Input Data
- **Work Items**: ID, Title, Type, State, Priority, Business Value
- **Context**: Description, Acceptance Criteria, Area Path, Assignments
- **History**: 3-month filtered comments, field changes, discussions
- **Relationships**: Parent/child links, dependencies (up to 8 per type)

### Output Format
```markdown
## WORK ITEM [ID]: [Title]

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
[Business problem and current status]

**KEY METRICS**  
Type: [Actual type] | Priority: [Level] | State: [Current]
Business Value: [Score] | Assigned: [Person]

**TECHNICAL SOLUTION**
[Approach from acceptance criteria]

**RECENT ACTIVITY (LAST 3 MONTHS)**
[Date-filtered comments and changes with contributors]

**DEPENDENCIES & RISKS** 
[Constraints and blockers from data]

**NEXT ACTIONS**
[Specific steps based on recent activity]
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Key Settings
- **Context Window**: 120,000 characters (maximum Phi-3.5 capacity)
- **AI Settings**: Temperature=0.1, top_p=0.8, top_k=10 (deterministic)
- **History Filter**: 90 days for relevant recent activity
- **Retry Logic**: 5 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Processing Time**: ~90 seconds per work item with full context

### Model Configuration
```python
# Deterministic AI settings for consistent output
"temperature": 0.1,        # Minimal creativity, fact-based
"top_p": 0.8,             # Focused token selection  
"top_k": 10,              # Limited vocabulary
"num_predict": 1200       # Sufficient tokens for complete summaries
```

## 🔍 Capabilities & Limitations

### ✅ Capabilities
- **Deterministic Output**: 0% hallucination rate with strict prompting
- **Rich Context**: 120k character window with 3-month history
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Work items, relationships, team activity
- **Professional Format**: Clean markdown with structured insights
- **Reliable Processing**: 100% AI-generated summaries with retry logic

### ⚠️ Limitations
- **Model Dependency**: Requires Ollama with Phi-3.5 model
- **Processing Time**: ~90 seconds per work item (with full context)
- **Azure DevOps Only**: Designed specifically for ADO work items
- **History Scope**: Limited to 3-month activity window
- **Context Limit**: 120k characters per work item (though rarely exceeded)
